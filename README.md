# UsefulUnityClasses
I'm in the process of making this much more usable and easy to quickly import into a project. For now it's advisable to not fork or clone this unless you want to deal with these problems yourself (feel free to do so and send a PR though)
I also need to update this with more class extensions I use day to day.

A selection of classes I often find useful and I don't want to reinvent the wheel.
